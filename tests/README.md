# Tests

These are made up of automated Php Tests, and manual Installer Tests that are described below.

## Php Tests

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/johnstevenson/composer-setup.png)](https://travis-ci.org/johnstevenson/composer-setup)

These test `setup.class.php` that is used by the setup exe to perform php-checking and downloading the Composer installer.

## Installer Tests

The following is a list of Installer Tests, which are not automated. In most cases these are initiated by running setup in *Test-Mode*, which is enabled with the `/TEST` command-line argument. This displays an *Enter Test* button that allows you to input the test identifier. Note that the command console will show briefly when checking the php settings in test-mode.


### Installer Php Tests

These tests are for checking the input on the *Php Settings* page. They should display the *Php Settings Error* page with the Next button disabled.

#### Invalid php.exe
* *Setup:* Run test-mode and select a file which isn't php.exe.

* *Expected:* Describes file as not a valid exe file, showing filename.



#### Invalid version
* *Setup:* Select a version of PHP < 5.3.2

* *Expected:* Describes error and shows current version.


#### Invalid settings
* *Setup:* Change php.ini, set `allow_url_fopen = off`.

* *Expected:* Describes error and shows the php.ini file used.


#### Invalid exit code
* *Setup:* Run test: `p1`.

* *Expected:* Reports that php.exe did not run correctly and shows the filename. Internal Error [ERR_STATUS], exit code 2.


#### Invalid exit code from php exception
* *Setup:* Run test: `p2`.

* *Expected:* Reports that php.exe did not run correctly and shows the filename. Internal Error [ERR_STATUS], exit code is `255`.


#### Empty result file
* *Setup:* Run test: `p3`.

* *Expected:* Reports that php.exe did not run correctly and shows the filename. Internal Error [ERR_RESULT], exit code 0


#### Invalid indentity in file
* *Setup:* Run test: `p4`.

* *Expected:* Reports that php.exe did not run correctly and shows the filename. Internal Error [ERR_INVALID], exit code 0


#### Success but lines in file
* *Setup:* Run test: `p5`.

* *Expected:* Reports that an internal script did not run correctly. Internal Error [ERR_LOGIC], exit code 0


#### Failed but no lines in file
* *Setup:* Run test: `p6`.

* *Expected:* Reports that an internal script did not run correctly. Internal Error [ERR_LOGIC], exit code 1


## Installer Path Tests

Run the installer/uninstaller with the `/LOG="path\to\log.txt"` command-line argument. The log displays the path before and after any changes.


## Installer Download Tests
The tests use test-mode and generally mimic responses from the install script. These should display the the *Composer Download Error*, except for test `d1` which should show the *Composer Warning* page.


#### Success with a warning
* *Setup:* Run test: `d1`.

* *Expected:* Reports a dummy warning, with a Next button.


#### Failed due to unsuitable Composer php settings
* *Setup:* Run test: `d2`.

* *Expected:* Reports a dummy Composer fatal error, with a disabled Next button


#### Failed due to internal php error
* *Setup:* Run test: `d3`.

* *Expected:* Reports an internal error [ERR_PHP], with a Retry button.


#### Failed connection
* *Setup:* Run test: `d4`, or disconnect from your network.

* *Expected:* Reports a connection error [ERR_CONNECTION], with a Retry button.


#### Success with a proxy warning
* *Setup:* Run test: `d5`.

* *Expected:* Reports warning about internet settings stopping Composer from working, with a Next button.

* *Setup:* Run test: `d6`.

* *Expected:* Reports a Composer error [ERR_STATUS] showing the exit code 15, with a Retry button.
